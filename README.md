### Application name: EZ-VALPARK

## Overview
Valet Parking Solutions app is designed to make valet parking easy for drivers and parking operators as well. It is a ticketless application. It generates a barcode for easy parking and checkout. The app is accessible to computer, laptops, tablets and mobile devices. The application uses several technologies in order to complete our vision. We will be able to:

1. Securely log in as administrators giving the application users peace of mind given that only registered users will be able to access their information.

2. Cars can be added and viewed in the App allowing the user to know how many cars are in the system.

3. The payment system is completely automated; this will allow for easier and faster checkout.

4. The user will be able to notify via text, the guests that the cars are ready to be picked up.

5. The guest will get a QR code notification in order to pick up the car. This is an additional security feature, that will limit human error.

We integrated React as the View layer, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js in the backend. Using the MVC paradigm to produce a full-stack MERN application. 

In the client side we used the React lifecycle methods to follow best practices to render our application to the React Dom. Asynchronous request (AJAX) calls to transport data as JSON text from the data base and several API's used in the project. 

In the backend we used CRUD operations to manage the database and also followed best practices on our server side in order to make the application run smoothly and error free.

#Technologies used
1. MERN stack.
2. Bcrypt for password encryption.
3. Twilio API to send text messages.
4. Stripe API for credit card payment.
5. React chart.js for rendering charts.
6. QR-code-React to generate the code in the text message.
7. Bootstrap and Material Design in the HTML.
8. SASS in our CSS libraries.
9. Open weather API to show the weather in the application.
10. Moment JS to show the times.
